A customer wanted to add links to table cells in a slightly different way.
So these changes to /admin/js/edit.min.js make right clicking in a cell bring up the insert link dialog/popup directly.

Don't know if thats something that you would want to do but if so here it is.
I'm on a Mac here so not tested it on a PC but works ok on Chrome and Firefox
